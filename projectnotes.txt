PROJECT GOALS
-- Build an M(odel)V(iews)C(ontroller) Sinatra application. DONE
-- Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra. DONE
-- Use multiple models. DONE
-- Use at least one has_many relationship on a User model and one belongs_to relationship on another model. DONE
-- Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
-- Validate uniqueness of user login attribute (username or email).
-- Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update and destroy the resource that belongs_to user.
-- Ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources - not resources created by other users.
-- Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database.
-- BONUS: Display validation failures to user with error messages. (This is an optional feature, challenge yourself and give it a shot!)
