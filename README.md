Tropiary is a small Sinatra project created for the second phase of Flatiron Software Engineer Boot Camp. It is primarily written in Sinatra/Ruby.

Upon login a user can create a novel and give it a summary. The user can then select from existing tropes to describe the novel more accurately, or just to describe the motifs, imagery, and devices used in the novel. A user can also create a new trope in the index to add to their novel. 

This was not originally intended for deployment, as there exist many useful writing tools to organize and describe fictional works. However, future expansion may see novels including more attributes such as genre, characters, length, etc. This project will continue to update for the purposes of practice.
